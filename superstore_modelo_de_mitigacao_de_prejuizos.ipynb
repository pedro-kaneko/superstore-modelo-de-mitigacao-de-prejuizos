        "# Introdução\n",
        "\n",
        "Neste notebook exploramos o conjunto de dados \"Superstore\", que contém informações detalhadas sobre as transações de um e-commerce que vende produtos de tecnologia, mobília e material de escritório. Este dataset é uma ferramenta útil para analisar o desempenho de vendas e desenvolver soluções para otimizar a rentabilidade da empresa.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objetivo\n",
        "\n",
        "O objetivo principal deste notebook é realizar uma análise abrangente dos dados de vendas para identificar problemas e oportunidades de melhoria. Utilizaremos técnicas de Machine Learning para desenvolver um modelo preditivo que estime a margem de lucro dos produtos antes de serem anunciados, com o intuito de mitigar prejuízos associados a descontos excessivos. Além disso, o notebook fornecerá instruções sobre como testar a eficácia do modelo em um ambiente de produção.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Atributos do Conjunto de Dados\n",
        "\n",
        "O conjunto de dados \"Superstore\" inclui os seguintes atributos:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Row_ID**: Identificador único para cada linha de transação.\n",
        "- **Order_ID**: Identificador único para cada pedido.\n",
        "- **Order_Date**: Data em que o pedido foi realizado.\n",
        "- **Ship_Date**: Data em que o pedido foi enviado.\n",
        "- **Tipo_de_Frete**: Tipo de frete utilizado para envio do pedido.\n",
        "- **Customer_ID**: Identificador único para cada cliente.\n",
        "- **Nome_do_Cliente**: Nome do cliente que realizou o pedido.\n",
        "- **Segment**: Segmento de mercado do cliente (Consumidor, Corporativo, Home-Office).\n",
        "- **Country**: País de origem do pedido (neste caso, sempre Estados Unidos).\n",
        "- **City**: Cidade de origem do pedido.\n",
        "- **State**: Estado de origem do pedido.\n",
        "- **Postal_Code**: Código postal de origem do pedido.\n",
        "- **Region**: Região de origem do pedido (Oeste, Leste, Central, Sul).\n",
        "- **Product_ID**: Identificador único para cada produto.\n",
        "- **Category**: Categoria do produto (Tecnologia, Mobília, Material de Escritório).\n",
        "- **Sub_Category**: Subcategoria do produto (por exemplo, Telefones, Cadeiras, Papel).\n",
        "- **Product_Name**: Nome do produto.\n",
        "- **Sales**: Valor total das vendas para o pedido.\n",
        "- **Quantity**: Quantidade de produtos vendidos.\n",
        "- **Discount**: Percentual de desconto aplicado no pedido.\n",
        "- **Profit**: Lucro obtido com o pedido após aplicar custos e descontos.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Resumo da Análise\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Exploração e Limpeza de Dados**:\n",
        "   - Entender a estrutura do conjunto de dados e realizar a limpeza necessária para garantir a qualidade dos dados.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Análise Descritiva e Diagnóstica**:\n",
        "   - Examinar o desempenho de vendas e lucro, identificar padrões e problemas, como descontos excessivos e políticas de preços inadequadas.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Desenvolvimento de Modelo de Machine Learning**:\n",
        "   - Criar um modelo preditivo para estimar a margem de lucro dos produtos antes de serem anunciados, com base em atributos como preço, desconto, categoria e região.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Validação e Teste do Modelo**:\n",
        "   - Avaliar a eficácia do modelo e verificar sua consistência ao aplicá-lo a novos conjuntos de dados, garantindo previsões robustas e confiáveis.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Planejamento de Experimento (RCT)**:\n",
        "   - Para garantir que o modelo funcione bem em um ambiente de produção, será realizado um planejamento de Teste Randomizado Controlado (RCT).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Validação de Experimento (Teste de Fisher)**:\n",
        "   - Simularemos os resultados do experimento e aplicaremos o Teste de Fisher para determinar se as diferenças observadas entre os grupos são estatisticamente significativas.\n",
        "\n",
        "Este notebook utiliza bibliotecas como Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib e Plotly para análise de dados, visualização e modelagem preditiva. Ao final, esperamos identificar estratégias para melhorar a rentabilidade da empresa, minimizando transações que geram prejuízos e oferecendo recursos práticos para testar e validar a proposta em um ambiente de produção.\n"

É importante garantir que o modelo minimize falsos positivos para evitar prejuízos e falsos negativos para não desperdiçar oportunidades de lucro.\n"

        "O percentual de transações que geram prejuízos é de 19.29%, indicando que, no modelo de negócios atual, uma parte significativa das transações resulta em prejuízos financeiros. A implementação do modelo visa especificamente reduzir essa taxa, e a taxa de falsos positivos, que atualmente é de 0.61%, reflete a capacidade do modelo de minimizar previsões incorretas de lucro onde, na verdade, há prejuízo. A redução drástica na taxa de falsos positivos representa um avanço significativo no combate à geração de prejuízos, uma vez que o modelo é mais eficaz em identificar corretamente as transações lucrativas e evitar aquelas que efetivamente resultam em perdas. Com uma precisão de 99.2% e uma taxa de falsos negativos de 4.95%, a melhoria é crucial para reduzir o impacto financeiro negativo e aprimorar a eficiência do processo de decisão. No entanto, é importante considerar a obtenção de amostras adicionais para as categorias subamostradas, a fim de melhorar ainda mais a performance do modelo."

        "4. **Executar um Teste Estatístico Comparativo:**\n",

        "Este projeto teve como objetivo mitigar os prejuízos financeiros causados por descontos excessivos em produtos no e-commerce \"Superstore\". Após uma análise detalhada dos dados de vendas e a identificação de problemas associados à formulação de preços, desenvolvemos um modelo preditivo de Machine Learning para estimar a margem de lucro dos produtos antes de serem anunciados na plataforma.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Principais Conclusões\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Análise dos Dados**:\n",
        "   - Identificamos padrões e anomalias nos dados de vendas que estavam contribuindo para os prejuízos. A análise revelou que descontos excessivos eram uma causa significativa dos prejuízos financeiros.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Modelo Preditivo**:\n",
        "   - Desenvolvemos e treinamos um modelo preditivo que estima a margem de lucro com base em variáveis como preço, desconto, categoria e região. Os testes mostraram que o modelo é capaz de reduzir em até 96,8% o número de transações que resultam em prejuízo.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Validação e Teste**:\n",
        "   - O modelo foi avaliado quanto à sua precisão e capacidade preditiva usando métricas como erro médio absoluto (MAE), erro quadrático médio (RMSE) e R², além de métricas de avaliação classificatória. Os resultados foram robustos e confiáveis, confirmando a eficácia do modelo em prever transações lucrativas e prejudiciais.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Experimento Controlado Randomizado (RCT)**:\n",
        "   - Realizamos um planejamento para um experimento controlado que validará o modelo em um ambiente de produção. O Teste Randomizado Controlado (RCT) será implementado para garantir que o modelo funcione de maneira eficaz e que as conclusões obtidas sejam estatisticamente significativas.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Validação Estatística**:\n",
        "   - Aplicamos o Teste de Fisher para confirmar a significância estatística das diferenças entre as transações com e sem a aplicação do modelo. Os resultados indicam que o modelo tem um impacto positivo significativo na redução de prejuízos.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Recomendação\n",
        "\n",
        "Recomendamos a implementação do modelo preditivo em um ambiente de produção controlado, com monitoramento contínuo para ajustes futuros com base em novos dados e feedback. A aplicação do modelo deve contribuir significativamente para a melhoria da rentabilidade da empresa, minimizando as transações que geram prejuízos.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Próximos Passos\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Implementação**: Integrar o modelo ao sistema de gestão de preços do e-commerce e acompanhar o desempenho em tempo real.\n",
        "- **Monitoramento e Ajustes**: Realizar uma revisão periódica do modelo para garantir que continue a atender aos objetivos de redução de prejuízos.\n",
        "- **Exploração de Melhorias**: Explorar possíveis melhorias no modelo, incluindo a incorporação de novas variáveis e técnicas avançadas de Machine Learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Com a adoção destas recomendações, a empresa poderá otimizar suas estratégias de precificação e promover um aumento na lucratividade, alinhando-se melhor com as melhores práticas de gestão de preços e marketing.\n"
